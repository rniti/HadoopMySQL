#**An experimental study on Hadoop and MySQL integration**

##Introduction
My project entitled “An experimental study on Hadoop and MySQL integration”. While working on my in class paper presentation on “MapReduce simplified data processing on large cluster” I came to know about MapReduce as one of the major components of Hadoop from programming aspect. I found Hadoop and big data processing is fascinating as Hadoop is the opposite of any relational database. Unlike MySQL where we have a set of tables and indices, Hadoop works with a set of text files, as we all have learnt about MySQL and other relational databases for querying and storing data in class and Hadoop is different so; I thought to integrate Hadoop and MySQL so we can transfer data from MySQL to Hadoop and vice versa for better performance. My project goal is to convert MySQL query results into txt files and transfer into Hadoop file system where many different kind of analysis could be performed on the data on a cluster hence increasing the performance in short period of time, For my project I am going to take some data from MYSQL and try to perform secondary analysis (Word Count) on the exported data. 

I am planning to achieve following in this project: 
1. Understand the Hadoop 
2. Installing and configuration the Hadoop  
3. MySQL integration with Hadoop
